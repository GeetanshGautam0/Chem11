# **Ancient Atomic Theories**
## **Empedocles**
`Born` 494 BCE <br>
`Died` 434 BCE

`Ideas`
> Matter is composed of four ***roots***  (gifts from gods)

<br>

## **Democitus**
`Born`: 460 BCE <br>
`Died`: 370 BCE

`Ideas`
> ***ATOMA*** - `Invisible/Indivisible`
>> * Eveything is composed of *atoma*, which are uncuttable
>> * *Atmoa* are solid
>> * *Atoma* interact **mechanically**
>>> *Today, we refer to these interactions as 'physical', 'chemical', or 'nuclear'*

## **Plato**
`Born`: 424 BCE <br>
`Died`: 328 BCE

`Ideas`
> ***ELEMENTA*** `(elements)`
> 
>> * **Earth** - The stuff they build buildings out of; **cubes**
>> * **Fire** - Hurts a lot; must be very pointy; **tetrahedron**
>> * **Air** - Doesn't hurt when hitting the face; **octahedron**
>> * **Water** - Flows; **Icosahedron** (20 sides)
>
>> Believed that the perfect shape was a ***sphere*** due to its *symmetry*
>
>> * Anything that is made of Earth goes *(falls)* towards Earth *(considered to be the centre of the universe at the time)*
>> * Anything that is comprised of water, will "fall" towards the water sphere (on the surface of the Earth).
>> * Anything that is comprised of air, will "rise" into the air sphere *(atmosphere)* *(goes up)*
>> * Anything that is comprised of fire, will *"rise towards the moon"*

## **Aristotle**
`Born` 384 BCE <br>
`Died` 322 BCE

`Ideas`
> * *Exanded on the work of [Plato](#Plato) by describing the the four elementa.*
> * Added another elementa called ***'(A)ether'***

>> ***Elementa Name*** | ***Temperture Description*** | ***Moisture Description***
>> --- | --- | --- 
>> **Earth** | Cold | Dry
>> **Air** | Hot | Wet
>> **Fire** | Hot | Dry
>> **Water** | Cold | Wet
>
>> **(A)ehter**: The divine stuff; makes planets (at the time, the ones visible with the naked eye *(Venus, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter)*)
>> * **(A)ether's** shape was considered to be the `divine shape` *(sphere)*

# `The Alchemists`

`Their Idea`
> Attempted to transmutate (change) elements into gold and other elements.
>> * Pb &#129094; Au (`Add fire`)
>> * Hg &#129094; Ag (`Add fire`) <br>
>> etc.
>
>> **Reasonining**
>> * (e.g.) Gold is **(~)** orange, fire is orange.
>> * (e.g.) Hg is lqiuidy Ag; boil off water (heat up = add fire) to turn it into Ag.
>
>> **The outcome**
>> * Inhaled toxic fumes; were affected by heavy metal poisoning; 
>>> * Started acting strange.
>>> * Nails' shapes were deformed.
>>> * Decorated lab coats with the `4 elementa`;
>> * Looked like wizards (the characters were inspired off the alchemists.)
>
>> **The significance**
>> * The alchemsists kept incredibly good records for whatever they did in the lab.

## **Dalton**
`Born` 1766 <br>
`Died` 1844

`Contributions`
> **1803**
>> The Law of Definite Proportions
>>> Atoms are combined in simple whole number ratios.

`Statements`
> **(1) Elements are composed of extremely small particles, too small to be seen**
>> * **(+)** Elements <u>are</u> extremely small
>> * **(-)** They <u>have</u> been seen (not with the naked eye, though.) 

> **(2) Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass, density [...] and atoms of different elements have different properties.**
>> * **(+)** e<sup>-</sup>'s and p<sup>+</sup>'s <u>are</u> are the same (atoms, not ions)
>> * **(-)** n<sup>0</sup>'s are different between **isotopes**.

> **(3) Atoms cannot be subdivided, created, or destroyed.**
>> * **(+)** Atoms of an <u>element</u> cannot be broken down further.
>> * **(-)** Matter can be made into energy, and vice versa.

> **(4) Atoms can combine to form compounds in simple whole number ratios**

> **(5) In chemical reactions, atoms can be combined, separated, or rearranged.**
>> * **Combined** = `Synthesis reactions`
>> * **Separated** = `Decomposition reactions`
>> * **Rearraged** = `Double/Single replacements`, `Acid/Base reactions`, `Combustion reactions`

* Developed the ***billiard ball*** model

## **Joseph John Thompson**
`Born` 1856 <br>
`Died` 1940

`Contributions`
> **1897**
>> Whilst working with a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), discovered **`corpussles`** (*e<sup>-</sup>*)
>> * Described these particles as the *building blocks of atoms*
>> * Depicted an extremely high *charge to mass ratio*
>> * Reported the mass to be approximately $\frac{1}{1000}$<sup>th</sup> of that of `H`
>>> Actual:  $\frac{1}{1800}$<sup>th</sup>
>
> **1904**
>> Discovers that atoms **<u>are</u>** divisible.
>>> (Hiroshima happened a few decades later)<br>
>>
>> **"Negatively charged corpussles orbit rapidly around a sea of positive charge, resulting in a *neutral atom*"**
>
> **1906**
>> Wins nobel prize for *"investigating the conduction of gases"*
>
> **1908**
>> Is knighted
>
> **1913**
>> Discovered that `Ne` has *two different masses* (**discovered isotopes for the fist time**)
>
> **1939**
>> George P. Thompson (son) gets a nobel prize for discovering the wave properties of e<sup>-</sup>'s.
>
> **1940**
>> Dies; gets burried at **Westminster Abby** next to **Sir Issac Newton**

* Developed the ***plum pudding*** model

## **Ernest Rutherford**
`Born` 1871 <br>
`Died` 1937

`Trivia`
* Worked at McGill University for some time.

`Contributions`
> **1898-1903**
>> Rutherford worked at McGill University as a student of [J.J. Thompson](#Joseph%20John%20Thompson)
on $\alpha$-particles and $\beta$-particles. (*how atoms decay*)
>
> **1907**
>> Published one of his papers <br>
>> **"$\alpha$ emissions were very similar to ionized helium"**
>>> Close, but not quite; an $\alpha$ emission <u>is</u> ionized helium
>
> **1908**
>> Wins nobel prize in chemistry for his investigation into the "disinigration of atoms." (radiation).
>
>> Stole the `gold foil expt.` from the `Geiger-Marsden Expt.`

* Developed the ***Rutherford*** model
